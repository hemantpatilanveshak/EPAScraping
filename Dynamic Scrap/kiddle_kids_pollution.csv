20,Pollution facts for kids,Human health,Overview of main health effects on humans from some common types of pollution.
21,Pollution facts for kids,Human health,"Bad air quality can kill many organisms, including humans. Ozone pollution can cause respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, throat inflammation, chest pain, and congestion. A 2010 analysis estimated that 1.2 million people died prematurely each year in China because of air pollution. The high smog levels China has been facing for a long time can do damage to civilians' bodies and cause diseases. The WHO estimated in 2007 that air pollution causes half a million deaths per year in India. Studies have estimated that the number of people killed each year in the United States could be over 50,000."
22,Pollution facts for kids,Human health,"Water pollution causes approximately 14,000 deaths per day, mostly in developing countries. In these countries, water is contaminated by untreated sewage. An estimated 500 million Indians have no access to a proper toilet. Over ten million people in India fell ill with waterborne illnesses in 2013, and 1,535 people died, most of them children. Nearly 500 million Chinese do not have access to safe drinking water."

28,Pollution facts for kids,Environment,Pollution is present widely in the environment. There are several effects of this:
29,Pollution facts for kids,Environment,"Biomagnification describes situations where toxins (such as heavy metals) become more concentrated.
Carbon dioxide emissions cause ocean acidification, which is the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans as CO
2 becomes dissolved into the ocean.
The emission of greenhouse gases leads to global warming, which can affect ecosystems in many ways.
Invasive species can out-compete native species and reduce biodiversity.
Nitrogen oxides are removed from the air by rain and fertilize land, which can change the species composition of ecosystems.
Smog and haze can reduce the amount of sunlight received by plants to carry out photosynthesis.
Soil can become infertile and unsuitable for plants. This will affect other organisms in the food web.
Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause acid rain, which lowers the pH value of soil.
Organic pollution of watercourses can deplete oxygen levels and reduce species diversity."
