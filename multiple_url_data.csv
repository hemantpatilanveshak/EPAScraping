What is Pollution Prevention (P2)?,,https://www.epa.gov/p2/learn-about-pollution-prevention
What is Pollution Prevention (P2)?,"Pollution prevention (P2) is any practice that reduces, eliminates, or prevents pollution at its source before it is created.  As shown by the EPA Waste Management Hierarchy, P2, also known as ""source reduction,"" is fundamentally different and, where feasible, more desirable than recycling, treatment or disposal.  It is often more cost effective to prevent pollution from being created at its source than to pay for control, treatment and disposal of waste products.  When less pollution is created, there are fewer impacts to human health and the environment.",https://www.epa.gov/p2/learn-about-pollution-prevention

The Greenhouse Effect,"The earth's temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet’s system. When sunlight reaches the earth’s surface, it can either be reflected back into space or absorbed by the earth. Incoming energy that is absorbed by the earth warms the planet. Once absorbed, the planet releases some of the energy back into the atmosphere as heat (also called infrared radiation). Solar energy that is reflected back to space does not warm the earth.",https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change
The Greenhouse Effect,"Certain gases in the atmosphere absorb energy, slowing or preventing the loss of heat to space. Those gases are known as “greenhouse gases.” They act like a blanket, making the earth warmer than it would otherwise be. This process, commonly known as the “greenhouse effect,” is natural and necessary to support life. However, the recent buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities has changed the earth's climate and resulted in dangerous effects to human health and welfare and to ecosystems.",https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change

The Greenhouse Effect,,https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change
Key Greenhouse Gases,"Most of the warming since 1950 has been caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.4 Greenhouse gases come from a variety of human activities, including burning fossil fuels for heat and energy, clearing forests, fertilizing crops, storing waste in landfills, raising livestock, and producing some kinds of industrial products.",https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change
Aerosols,,https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change
Aerosols,"Aerosols in the atmosphere can affect climate. Aerosols are microscopic (solid or liquid) particles that are so small that instead of quickly falling to the surface like larger particles, they remain suspended in the air for days to weeks. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and biomass, contribute to emissions of these substances, although some aerosols also come from natural sources such as volcanoes and marine plankton.",https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change
Aerosols,"Unlike greenhouse gases, the climate effects of aerosols vary depending on what they are made of and where they are emitted. Depending on their color and other factors, aerosols can either absorb or reflect sunlight. Aerosols that reflect sunlight, such as particles from volcanic eruptions or sulfur emissions from burning coal, have a cooling effect. Those that absorb sunlight, such as black carbon (a part of soot), have a warming effect.",https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change
Aerosols,"Not only can black carbon directly absorb incoming and reflected sunlight, but it can also absorb infrared radiation.6 Black carbon can also be deposited on snow and ice, darkening the surface and thereby increasing the snow's absorption of sunlight and accelerating melt.7 While reductions in all aerosols can lead to more warming, targeted reductions in black carbon emissions can reduce global warming. Warming and cooling aerosols can also interact with clouds, changing their ability to form and dissipate, as well as their reflectivity and precipitation rates. Clouds can contribute both to cooling, by reflecting sunlight, and warming, by trapping outgoing heat.",https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change
Climate Feedbacks,Climate feedbacks are natural processes that respond to global warming by offsetting or further increasing change in the climate system.

Carbon Dioxide,"Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas contributing to recent climate change. Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels, solid waste, trees, and other biological materials, and as a result of certain chemical reactions, such as cement manufacturing. Carbon dioxide is absorbed and emitted naturally as part of the carbon cycle, through plant and animal respiration, volcanic eruptions, and ocean-atmosphere exchange.",https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change
Carbon Dioxide,"The Carbon Cycle

The carbon cycle is the process by which carbon continually moves from the atmosphere to the earth and then back to the atmosphere. On the earth, carbon is stored in rocks, sediments, the ocean, and in living organisms. Carbon is released back into the atmosphere when plants and animals die, as well as when fires burn, volcanoes erupt, and fossil fuels (such as coal, natural gas, and oil) are combusted. The carbon cycle ensures there is a balanced concentration of carbon in the different reservoirs on the planet. But a change in the amount of carbon in one reservoir affects all the others. Today, people are disturbing the carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and through land use changes that remove plants, which absorb carbon from the atmosphere.",https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change

Water Vapor,"Water vapor is another greenhouse gas and plays a key role in climate feedbacks because of its heat-trapping ability. Warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air. Therefore, as greenhouse gas concentrations increase and global temperatures rise, the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also increases, further amplifying the warming effect.5",https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/basics-climate-change

Fossil Fuel Air Pollution Kills One in Five People

February 19, 2021
Latest NewsInternationalClara Chaisson

          The global toll of premature deaths attributed to the burning of coal, gasoline, and diesel is breathtakingly high, with new research doubling previous estimates.",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis
Smog and soot,"These are the two most prevalent types of air pollution. Smog (sometimes referred to as ground-level ozone) occurs when emissions from combusting fossil fuels react with sunlight. Soot (also known as particulate matter) is made up of tiny particles of chemicals, soil, smoke, dust, or allergens—in the form of either gas or solids—that are carried in the air. The sources of smog and soot are similar. “Both come from cars and trucks, factories, power plants, incinerators, engines, generally anything that combusts fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or natural gas,” Walke says.",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis
Smog and soot,"Smog can irritate the eyes and throat and also damage the lungs, especially those of children, senior citizens, and people who work or exercise outdoors. It’s even worse for people who have asthma or allergies: these extra pollutants can intensify their symptoms and trigger asthma attacks. The tiniest airborne particles in soot, whether gaseous or solid, are especially dangerous because they can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream and worsen bronchitis, lead to heart attacks, and even hasten death. In 2020 a report from Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health showed COVID-19 mortality rates in areas with more soot pollution were higher than in areas with even slightly less, showing a correlation between the virus’s deadliness and long-term exposure to fine particulate matter and illuminating an environmental justice issue.",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis
Smog and soot,"Because highways and polluting facilities have historically been sited in or next to low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, the negative effects of this pollution have been disproportionately experienced by the people who live in these communities. In 2019 the Union of Concerned Scientists found that soot exposure was 34 percent higher for Asian Americans, on average, than for other Americans. For Black people, the exposure rate was 24 percent higher; for Latinos, 23 percent higher.",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis
Hazardous air pollutants,"A number of air pollutants pose severe health risks and can sometimes be fatal even in small amounts. Almost 200 of them are regulated by law; some of the most common are mercury, lead, dioxins, and benzene. “These are also most often emitted during gas or coal combustion, incinerating, or—in the case of benzene—found in gasoline,” Walke says. Benzene, classified as a carcinogen by the EPA, can cause eye, skin, and lung irritation in the short term and blood disorders in the long term. Dioxins, more typically found in food but also present in small amounts in the air, can affect the liver in the short term and harm the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems as well as reproductive functions. Mercury attacks the central nervous system. In large amounts, lead can damage children’s brains and kidneys, and even minimal exposure can affect children’s IQ and ability to learn.",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis
Hazardous air pollutants,"Another category of toxic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are by-products of traffic exhaust and wildfire smoke. In large amounts they have been linked to eye and lung irritation, blood and liver issues, and even cancer. In one study, the children of mothers exposed to PAHs during pregnancy showed slower brain-processing speeds and more pronounced symptoms of ADHD.",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis
Greenhouse gases,"By trapping the earth’s heat in the atmosphere, greenhouse gases lead to warmer temperatures, which in turn lead to the hallmarks of climate change: rising sea levels, more extreme weather, heat-related deaths, and the increased transmission of infectious diseases. In 2018 carbon dioxide accounted for 81 percent of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and methane made up 10 percent. “Carbon dioxide comes from combusting fossil fuels, and methane comes from natural and industrial sources, including large amounts that are released during oil and gas drilling,” Walke says. “We emit far larger amounts of carbon dioxide, but methane is significantly more potent, so it’s also very destructive.” Another class of greenhouse gases, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide in their ability to trap heat. In October 2016 more than 140 countries reached an agreement to reduce the use of these chemicals—which are found in air conditioners and refrigerators—and develop greener alternatives over time. Though President Trump was unwilling to sign on to this agreement, a bipartisan group of senators overrode his objections in 2020 and set the United States on track to slash HFCs by 85 percent by 2035. According to David Doniger, senior strategic director of NRDC’s Climate and Clean Energy program, “the agreed-to HFC phasedown will avoid the equivalent of more than 80 billion tons of carbon dioxide over the next 35 years.”",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis
Pollen and mold,"Mold and allergens from trees, weeds, and grass are also carried in the air, are exacerbated by climate change, and can be hazardous to health. Though they aren’t regulated and are less directly connected to human actions, they can be considered a form of air pollution. “When homes, schools, or businesses get water damage, mold can grow and can produce allergenic airborne pollutants,” Knowlton says. “Mold exposure can precipitate asthma attacks or an allergic response, and some molds can even produce toxins that would be dangerous for anyone to inhale.”",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis
Pollen and mold,"Pollen allergies are worsening because of climate change. “Lab and field studies are showing that pollen-producing plants—especially ragweed—grow larger and produce more pollen when you increase the amount of carbon dioxide that they grow in,” Knowlton says. “Climate change also extends the pollen production season, and some studies are beginning to suggest that ragweed pollen itself might be becoming a more potent allergen.” If so, more people will suffer runny noses, fevers, itchy eyes, and other symptoms.",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis
Pollen and mold,"Air pollution is now the world’s fourth-largest risk factor for early death. According to the most recent State of Global Air report—which summarizes the latest scientific understanding of air pollution around the world—4.5 million deaths were linked to outdoor air pollution exposures in 2019, and another 2.2 million deaths were caused by indoor air pollution. “Despite improvements in reducing global average mortality rates from air pollution, the world’s most populous countries, India and China, continue to bear the highest burdens of disease,” says Vijay Lamaye, staff scientist at the NRDC Science Center. “This report is a sobering reminder that the climate crisis threatens to worsen air pollution problems significantly if we fail to act to cut carbon pollution.”",https://www.nrdc.org/stories/air-pollution-everything-you-need-know#whatis

Key facts,"Air pollution is one of the greatest environmental risk to health. By reducing air pollution levels, countries can reduce the burden of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma.
In 2019, 99% of the world’s population was living in places where the WHO air quality guidelines levels were not met.
The combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated with 6.7 million premature deaths annually.
Ambient (outdoor) air pollution is estimated to have caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019.
Some 89% of those premature deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions.
Policies and investments supporting cleaner transport, energy efficient homes, power generation, industry and better municipal waste management would reduce key sources of outdoor air pollution. Access to clean household energy would also greatly reduce ambient air pollution in some regions.",https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health

Policies reducing air pollution,There are many examples of successful policies that reduce air pollution:,https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health
Policies reducing air pollution,"for industry: clean technologies that reduce industrial smokestack emissions; improved management of urban and agricultural waste, including capture of methane gas emitted from waste sites as an alternative to incineration (for use as biogas);for energy: ensuring access to affordable clean household energy solutions for cooking, heating and lighting;for transport: shifting to clean modes of power generation; prioritizing rapid urban transit, walking and cycling networks in cities as well as rail interurban freight and passenger travel; shifting to cleaner heavy-duty diesel vehicles and low-emissions vehicles and fuels, including fuels with reduced sulfur content;for urban planning: improving the energy efficiency of buildings and making cities more green and compact, and thus energy efficient;for power generation: increased use of low-emissions fuels and renewable combustion-free power sources (like solar, wind or hydropower); co-generation of heat and power; and distributed energy generation (e.g. mini-grids and rooftop solar power generation);for municipal and agricultural waste management: strategies for waste reduction, waste separation, recycling and reuse or waste reprocessing, as well as improved methods of biological waste management such as anaerobic waste digestion to produce biogas, are feasible, low-cost alternatives to the open incineration of solid waste – where incineration is unavoidable, then combustion technologies with strict emission controls are critical; andfor health-care activities: putting health services on a low-carbon development path can support more resilient and cost-efficient service delivery, along with reduced environmental health risks for patients, health workers and the community. In supporting climate friendly policies, the health sector can display public leadership while also improving health service delivery.",https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health

What Is Environmental Pollution?,"The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines pollution as “any substances in water, soil, or air that degrades the natural quality of the environment; offends [the senses]; causes a health hazard; or [impairs] the usefulness of natural resources.”",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
What Is Environmental Pollution?,"Put simply, pollution is any substance that causes harm upon entering the environment.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
What Is Environmental Pollution?,"There are many ways to classify pollution, but one common framework distinguishes “point source” – or pollution that comes from a single identifiable source – from “non-point source,” which is trickier to pin down.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
What Is Environmental Pollution?,Smokestacks from power plants emit carbon dioxide and particulate matter. Leakage from gasoline storage tanks. Discharge pipes at a wastewater treatment plant. A drainage ditch on a feedlot that seeps into groundwater – These are all examples of point-source pollution.,https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
What Is Environmental Pollution?,"Nonpoint-source pollution, by contrast, is wider spread, originating from many sources spanning large areas. For example, agricultural runoff containing fertilizers, pesticides, and particulate matter from thousands of acres of farmland is considered a non-point source. Urban and suburban runoff containing oil, grease, pet waste and other hazardous materials is also non-point source pollution.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
What Is Environmental Pollution?,"That said, there are many types of pollution that cause a wide range of environmental problems. The list that follows offers a glimpse into several of these types.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
7 Types of Pollution and Their Causes,"The main causes of environmental pollution include urbanization and industrialization, agricultural activities, mining, burning of fossil fuels, plastic and particulate matter. These all contribute to the following:",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Environmental Pollution and Farming,"From pesticides to fertilizer runoff, from greenhouse gas emissions to harmful particulates, the by-products of modern agriculture can have unintended consequences for ecosystems and human health.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Environmental Pollution and Farming,"As mentioned, agriculture can be a source of non-point source water pollution, causing algal blooms, but can also contribute to air pollution, soil pollution, noise pollution, and even plastic pollution. Several causes of agricultural pollution include:",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Environmental Pollution and Farming,"Particulate matter erodes from farm fields and enters waterways as runoff, causing sedimentation (i.e. the clouding of water) and subsequent harm to aquatic ecosystems. Agrochemicals such as pesticides that contaminate soil, directly damaging above- and below-ground ecosystems.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Environmental Pollution and Farming,"The manufacturing of agrochemicals — especially synthetic nitrogen — is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural plastics used for weed control, representing over 12 million tons annually, are often not disposed of properly. In many cases, these plastics find their way into ecosystems and soil as microplastics.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/

Air pollution,"Air pollution is caused by harmful gases and aerosols (solids and liquids suspended in the air) that are released through both natural processes and human activities. Wildfires and volcanoes, for example, release particulate matter and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. A majority of air pollution, however, is generated by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and oil for electricity, transportation, and industry.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Air pollution,Common air pollutants include:,https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Air pollution,"Particulate matter (dust, dirt, soot, smoke, etc.)Direct greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (CH4), trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to climate change.Indirect greenhouse gases such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are released during the burning of fossil fuels and biomass (e.g. wood). These compounds chemically react in the atmosphere to form more dangerous substances that intensify climate change and harm human health.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Water pollution,"Water is an important natural resource that is crucial to all life on earth, though only .5% of earth’s water is fresh, accessible, and drinkable.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Water pollution,"Water pollution in the form of microbial pathogens, nutrients, and hazardous substances contaminates both freshwater and saltwater ecosystems, harming aquatic life and public health.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Water pollution,"One notable example of water pollution is nonpoint-source agricultural pollution.  After intense rain events, agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, and particulate matter from eroded soil can enter streams, rivers, lakes, bays and even oceans. From here, excess concentrations of nutrients like phosphorous and nitrogen spur the growth of algal blooms, which deplete the water of oxygen in a process known as eutrophication. The resulting “fish kills,” “dead zones,” and drinking water crises are common throughout the United States, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. Agricultural practices that build soil health and minimize synthetic inputs can actually reduce water pollution.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Water pollution,"In addition to agricultural runoff, other sources of water pollution include:",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Water pollution,"Industrial waste may include organic compounds, heavy metals, nutrients or radioactive material.Marine dumping (when garbage and other waste products are dumped into the ocean)Solid wastes, wastewater, and sewage that escape outdated treatment plants pose a threat to human health and aquatic ecosystems, introducing hazardous compounds and pathogens into waterways.Oil leaks and oil spills are high-profile examples of water pollution.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Water pollution,"Greenhouse gases can actually affect water quality. The ocean, for example, is a “carbon sink,” meaning it absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere. This actually acidifies the ocean, making it inhospitable for certain creatures.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Water pollution,"Although water pollution is serious business, it is not without solutions. New efforts focused on sensitive watersheds aim to limit agricultural pollution through nutrient load limits and waste management incentives, while laws like the Clean Water Act regulate industrial waste in developed countries.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Water pollution,"Local and national efforts to restore wetlands are underway in many places, which recognize the importance of wetlands in mitigating the effects of pollution. Wetlands not only trap sediments and particulate matter, filtering harmful nutrients and chemicals, but also support a wealth of biodiversity.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Plastic pollution,"Of the 380 million tons of plastic produced per year, some 31 million tons will enter the environment and around 8 million will enter the ocean.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Plastic pollution,"As they degrade in the environment, plastic bottles and plastic waste becomes “microplastics,” small particles of plastic that find their way into food chains, soil, rain, snow – even our lungs – in high levels. A recent study demonstrates that people ingest around a credit card’s worth of microplastics every week, with yet unknown health effects.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Plastic pollution,"Some scientists speculate chemical toxicity from microplastics might affect pregnancy or cause cancer. Others fear “nano-plastics” – plastic particles even smaller still – may enter cells and disrupt cellular activity. Mitigation efforts such as re-cycling only go so far; for example, much of the plastic that is “re-cycled” is not, in fact, recycled, instead of shipped to developing countries where it re-enters the environment.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Soil contamination,"Contaminated soils are common throughout the industrialized world, with the most common pollutants including agrochemicals, petrochemicals, microplastics, acid rain, and industrial waste.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Soil contamination,"In some cases, soils are polluted through agricultural practices, including the application of pesticides, fertilizers, and irrigation water that contain microbial pathogens, heavy metals like cadmium, lead, mercury and arsenic, and other bio-toxic substances. While some pesticides and herbicides degrade readily, other agrochemicals are “persistent,” meaning the agrochemical and its byproducts linger in the soil, sometimes up to 10 years.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Soil contamination,Other sources of contaminated soil include industrial waste. These may be known as “brownfields” — areas that require remediation before they are suitable for human use.,https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Soil contamination,"When contaminated soil comes in direct contact with humans and wildlife via food or dust, or indirectly by seeping into drinking water, a number of negative health effects may result depending on the contaminant, concentration, and exposure.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Noise pollution and light pollution,"Seemingly harmless compared to plastic, water, and air pollution, noise and light pollution can damage ecosystems. Often associated with urbanization, noise pollution is defined by the EPA as “unwanted or disturbing sound” and light pollution as “excessive brightness that causes discomfort.” Both noise and light pollution can harm human health and wildlife, affecting sleep, decreasing fitness, and altering behavior.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Radioactive contamination,"When thinking about radioactive contamination, Fukushima or Chernobyl may come to mind. However, radioactive contamination is more widespread than these isolated incidents, with possibly 45,000 sites contaminated with radioactive materials across the US, according to the EPA.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Radioactive contamination,"Radioactive contaminants are generated by uranium mines, nuclear reactors, and test laboratories, where they can enter the environment.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Radioactive contamination,"For example, uranium mining can release radiation into the soil, at which point rain washes this material into drinking water. In fact, up to 170 million Americans drink tap water contaminated with radioactive materials. High levels of exposure to these materials can cause cancer, reproductive dysfunction, and myriad other health effects.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
Electromagnetic pollution,"Much of the technology we use today — from our cell phones to our laptops to the wi-fi that connects them — generates an electromagnetic field. At certain frequencies and exposure levels, this energy can be considered toxic (for example, strong fields have been shown to cause burns). That being said, the jury’s still out on whether our current exposure to electromagnetic energy is detrimental to human health and wildlife.",https://www.agrivi.com/blog/environmental-pollution/
