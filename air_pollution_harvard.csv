Air Pollution,Transport,"Diseases from Air Pollution:
Air pollutants may cause diseases, especially those to the respiratory system. When certain air pollutants are breathed in, the airways to the lungs can become irritated. This is called bronchitis. Some air pollutants lead to  asthma where chemicals in our bodies make the muscles around the airways to constrict. This makes the airways very small, thus causing wheezing, coughing, and general breathing difficulties. Continued exposure to air pollution may also cause a decrease in lung function. This is especially a problem in children whose lungs are still growing. If the lungs do not grow to their fullest size, when the children get older, they will not be able to exercise or do heavy work as well as they could.  Air pollutants may also affect other parts of our bodies.  If the chemicals get into the blood, they can be taken to all parts of the body, and may cause problems in other organs, such as the heart and brain. Some gases in large amounts may cause death.",https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ehep/air-pollution/
Air Pollution,Transport,"What You Can Do?  Natural air pollution has always been around – volcanoes, forest fires, dust storms. But, in today’s society, air pollution also comes from many man-made sources. This is the pollution we need to reduce. Even though it is impossible to remove all air pollution, there is much you can do.
Turn off electrical equipment: Turn off lights, televisions, radios, and other electrical equipment when they are not being used. Power plants usually use coal, oil, gas, or nuclear energy to produce the electricity. If power plants use less fuel, fewer particles and gases are put into the air we breathe.
Wear sweaters indoors during the winter: Keeping the heat in your home at a lower temperature will also use less energy and cause less air pollution.
Walk or ride a bike whenever possible: If you have to go a long distance, ask your parents if you can take public transportation or ride with several people.
Do not smoke: Smoking causes gases and particles to get into the smokers lungs and cause disease, and also forms air pollution that affects others in the area. Try to get friends and family members who smoke to quit the habit.
Use fewer chemicals in your home: Chemicals you use in your house, including those from household cleaners, and art supplies, could cause air pollution levels to be greater inside than outside. Try to use fewer chemicals and more ventilation. Opening windows, even for short times in the winter will lower the indoor air pollution levels, but not increase heating costs by too much.
Call the Environmental Protection Agency: If you notice a company emitting excessive smoke into the air, contact your local EPA office and inform them.",https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ehep/air-pollution/

Biological Pollution,Toxic,"the muscles around the tubes that bring the air into our lungs to constrict. This makes the tubes small in diameter. If this happens, a person cannot breathe.

Biological Pollution,Toxic,"What You Can Do?
Make sure walls and ceilings are dry: Fungi, including molds, need moisture to grow. Using proper ventilation – especially in the bathroom – will keep surfaces dry. If mold begins to grow on walls, ceilings, or bathroom tiles, wipe it with a dilute bleach solution, if possible, to kill it (1 part bleach to 20 parts water).
Use air conditioning in the summer: When outdoor pollen and fungal spore levels are high, air conditioning will allow windows to be kept closed, thus blocking the entry of these airborne particles which may cause allergies.
Avoid having allergy-causing animals in your home: If you have an allergy to certain animals, such as cats, avoid keeping such animals as pets. Animal dander (dead skin cells) and other animal-shed particles cause many allergies. Short-haired or non shedding animals (such as hamsters), may make better pets.
Use “mite-proof” pillow and mattress covers: People who are allergic to dust mites can benefit from covering their bedding with special covers. Wash pillow cases, mattress covers, and sheets in hot (not warm) water to kill mites.
Remove carpets: Many fungal spores, dust mites, animal dander, and other allergens collect in carpeting. Removing the carpets may benefit those who suffer from these allergies.
It is almost impossible to clean all the biological pollutants from the environment. Nor should we want to, because some serve very important purposes. However, you can reduce the number of allergy and asthma causing organisms in your home. While none of these actions are guaranteed to eliminate the symptoms, they are often effective in reducing them.",https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ehep/biological-pollution/

Water Pollution,Watershed,"Water pollutants may cause disease or act as poisons. Bacteria and parasites in poorly treated sewage may enter drinking water supplies and cause digestive problems such as cholera and diarrhea. Hazardous chemicals, pesticides, and herbicides from industries, farms, homes and golf courses can cause acute toxicity and immediate death, or chronic toxicity that can lead to neurological problems or cancers. Many water pollutants enter our bodies when we use water for drinking and food preparation. The pollutants enter the digestive tract. From there, they can reach other organs in the body and cause various illnesses. Chemicals come in contact with the skin from washing clothes, or from swimming in polluted water and may lead to skin irritations. Hazardous chemicals in water systems can also affect the animals and plants which live there. Sometimes these organisms will survive with the chemicals in their systems, only to be eaten by humans who may then become mildly ill or develop stronger toxic symptoms.
